LIB PATH
========

This directory is very important because it contains at least PHP Markdown lib and can contains optional other libs like following:
 - YAML Parser from Symphony project if you couldnâ€™t have yaml PECL extension.
 - Alternate template engines like Rain PHP, h2o and maybe other in the futur.
